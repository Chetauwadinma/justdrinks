## About The Project

JustDrinks Analysis is a comprehensive data analysis project designed to provide deep insights into JustDrinks' operational data, including purchases, invoices, inventory, and vendor relationships. Our goal is to transform raw data into actionable intelligence, enabling the CEO and CFO to make more informed and strategic decisions.

This analysis specifically addresses critical business questions such as:

* Optimizing product shelf life and minimizing waste.
* Identifying the fastest-moving products to streamline inventory and sales strategies.
* Understanding sales trends over various periods to capitalize on demand patterns.
* Laying the groundwork for future, more effective data-driven initiatives.

By leveraging this analysis, JustDrinks can enhance operational efficiency, improve profitability, and maintain a competitive edge in the market.

## Key Features

This analysis provides the following key insights and functionalities:

* **Shelf Life Optimization:** Visualizations and reports to track product shelf life, highlighting items nearing expiration and informing inventory rotation strategies.
* **Fastest Selling Products Identification:** Clear identification of top-performing products based on sales velocity, guiding procurement and marketing efforts.
* **Sales Trend Analysis:** In-depth examination of sales patterns across different times (daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal) to predict demand and optimize staffing/stocking.
* **Inventory Health Dashboard:** Insights into current inventory levels, historical stock movement, and potential areas for reduction in holding costs.
* **Vendor Performance Overview:** (If applicable in your Power BI) Analysis of vendor data to assess reliability, delivery times, and cost efficiency.
* **Interactive Dashboards:** User-friendly and interactive Power BI dashboards that allow executives to explore data dynamically and drill down into details.
* **Executive Summaries:** Concise PowerPoint presentations summarizing key findings and actionable recommendations for top-level stakeholders.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes robust tools for data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization:

* **SQL (Structured Query Language):** For querying, cleaning, and preparing the raw data from the company's purchase, invoice, inventory, and vendor databases.
* **Power BI:** For creating interactive, dynamic, and insightful dashboards and reports that visualize complex data patterns.
* **Microsoft PowerPoint:** For compiling executive summaries and presenting key findings and strategic recommendations to stakeholders.

## Getting Started

This section outlines how the project can be accessed and utilized by the CEO and CFO.

### Prerequisites

To access and interact with the Power BI analysis, you will need:

* **Power BI Desktop** (for those who wish to open the `.pbix` file directly)
* **Power BI Service Account** (for accessing published reports and dashboards online, recommended for ease of access and sharing)

### Accessing the Analysis

The primary way to access the JustDrinks Analysis project is through the shared Power BI reports and dashboards.

1.  **Via Power BI Service:**
    * You will receive a direct link to the published Power BI report/dashboard from the project team.
    * Log in to your Power BI Service account.
    * Click the provided link to view the interactive dashboards and reports in your web browser.

2.  **Via Power BI Desktop (for deeper exploration):**
    * The core `.pbix` file will be provided upon request.
    * Ensure Power BI Desktop is installed on your machine.
    * Open the `.pbix` file directly in Power BI Desktop to explore the underlying data model and report structure.

## Usage

Once accessed, the Power BI dashboards are designed for intuitive exploration:

* **Navigate Tabs:** Use the tabs at the bottom (or side) of the dashboard to switch between different analytical views (e.g., "Shelf Life Analysis," "Fast Sellers," "Sales Trends").
* **Apply Filters:** Utilize the filters and slicers on the reports to refine your view by date range, product category, vendor, etc.
* **Drill Down:** Many visualizations allow you to click on elements (e.g., a bar in a bar chart) to drill down into more detailed data.
* **Executive Summaries:** Refer to the accompanying PowerPoint presentations for a high-level overview of findings and actionable recommendations derived from the data. These presentations distill the most critical insights for strategic decision-making.
